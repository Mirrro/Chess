  name: Kevin Blunder
  description: 'Kevin is a 19-year-old college student who discovered chess last
    semester when he accidentally joined the campus chess club thinking it was a
    checkers meetup. He still struggles to remember how knights move but has an infectious
    enthusiasm and a never-say-die attitude. His games are chaotic, impulsive, and
    often hilarious - and once in a while, brilliance emerges by sheer accident.
    His motto: "What''s castling again?"'
  title: Chess Club Member

  - Yup. Just made some kind of move.
  - Is this what strategy feels like?
  - This move was 30% instinct, 70% panic.
  - Okay okay, not bad for me.
  - Check out this premium positioning.

  - "You\u2019re in trouble now. Maybe."
  - "I\u2019ve never moved that one before!"
  - Watch out - this is where I accidentally get good.
  - "That\u2019s right, I planned that. Totally."
  - All part of the grand... something.
  - "I\u2019m in my tactical era."
  - "They told me I couldn\u2019t play chess. Joke\u2019s on them."

  - Nooo! That was my lucky piece!
  - Plot twist! I lose a piece.
  - I definitely meant for that to happen.
  - "You\u2019re not supposed to see that stuff."
  - Ugh. That felt personal.
  - That was part of my... reverse strategy.
  - "Guess I won\u2019t be needing that anymore."
  - Are you reading my mind or something?
  - "Let\u2019s call that a tactical donation."
  - Was that legal? Emotionally, I mean.
  thinkingQuote:
  - "Let\u2019s see how deep this rabbit hole goes."
  - I could win with my second-best line here.
  - "So many options\u2026 none of them good for you."
  - Time to calculate - not that I need to.
  - Do I go for style or efficiency?
  - "Let\u2019s untangle this mess you\u2019ve made."
  - Hmm. Should I go easy or educational?
  - So many flaws to exploit. Where to start?
  - "This shouldn\u2019t take long."
  - "Let\u2019s pretend this is a challenge."
  - "You won\u2019t like what\u2019s coming."
  - The silence before the storm. Listen closely.

  - Boom! Gotcha!
  - "I don\u2019t know how I did that but I\u2019m hyped."

  - Oops! Was that important?
  - Aha! I have struck!
  - "Are you even trying? Wait - don\u2019t answer that."
  promotionInFavourQuote:
  - LEVEL UP, BABY!
  - I knew this little guy had potential.
  - "Oh we\u2019re fancy now."
  - I think I broke the game. In a good way.
  - From zero to hero. Just like me.
  - That pawn just made it out the hood.
  - Bow down to my upgraded chaos.
  promotionAgainstQuote:
  - Wait - wait - hold on, you can DO that?
  - Oh cool, just casually summoning a boss fight.
  - "That\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine."
  - Cool cool cool. Just casually ruining my whole strategy.
  - "That\u2019s not terrifying at all."
  - Can we agree to just not use that piece?
