  name: Magnus Veldt
  description: A mysterious legend in the chess world, Magnus Veldt is rumored to
    have trained in silence for ten years in a mountain monastery where the only
    board was made of stone. Now in his sixties, Magnus has seen every gambit, counter-gambit,
    and psychological ploy imaginable. He rarely speaks, letting his flawless positional
    play and ice-cold endgames do the talking. To beat him, you must become the board.
