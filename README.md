# Unity Chess AI

* Minimax Algorithm: Searches for the optimal move by exploring possible future positions.
  * Alpha-Beta Pruning: Dramatically reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the minimax algorithm.
  * Move Sorting: Orders moves heuristically to maximize pruning efficiency.
  * Transposition Table: Caches evaluation results of previously visited positions to avoid redundant calculations.
* Multiple Difficulties: Three AI opponents with different search depths for beginner, intermediate, and expert play.
* Save & Load: The game will be saved after each move.
